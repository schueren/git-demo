## 2nd level heading - Example text (AFL Draft)
GREATER Western Sydney will continue its search for a top-five draft pick, despite not reaching an agreement to move higher up the order on the final day of the Telstra AFL Trade Period.
The Giants had been locked in discussions with the Demons throughout the final days of the Trade Period about trying to secure a deal for pick No.3, but ultimately couldn't reach an agreement throughout the 10-day window.

However, the Giants knew they wouldn't have to rush to find a deal before Wednesday's 7.30pm AEDT trade deadline, with new AFL rules enabling clubs to still move picks until the days leading up to the NAB AFL Draft.
The cut-off date to trade draft picks this year is Friday 22 November at 2pm AEDT.
